## Why Proxima?

In late 2025, I hit a massive roadblock with AI coding tools. Outdated training data caused coding models to frequently hallucinate, guess wrong solutions, and ruin codebases. I tried setting up local agents using Model Context Protocol (MCP) APIs, but the results were disappointing. The API responses were subpar and inaccurate, all while running up a bill for every single prompt.

That’s when a wild idea struck: What if we could turn actual web-based models—like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Perplexity—into local MCP servers? By routing queries directly through free, logged-in browser accounts, I could give my local agents access to frontier reasoning models. No expensive API keys required.

Proxima was born as a personal utility. I used it heavily for months to streamline my own work with no plans to open-source it. However, seeing other developers struggle with the same API costs and model hallucinations, I decided to share it. Proxima was created to provide a local, privacy-focused routing engine that connects development tools to active sessions without requiring paid subscriptions or API plans.

<details>
<summary><b>TL;DR: Common Pain Points Solve</b></summary>

*   **API Subscription Fatigue:** Stacking multiple AI subscriptions (ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, Perplexity Pro) adds up fast.
*   **Costly Development Keys:** Querying raw API endpoints directly from code editor extensions drains credits quickly on large codebases.
*   **Local-Model Privacy:** When running fully local models via Ollama or LM Studio, your code never leaves your machine — no cloud provider, no data exposure.
*   **Fragmented Tooling:** Constantly switching between browser windows, terminals, and editor panels disrupts your cognitive coding flow.
</details>

### The Solution: Proxima
Proxima serves as a local development gateway that centralizes and runs all your AI models together on `127.0.0.1`. By handling protocol translation and session routing in the background, it enables your coding agents and development clients to interact with multiple advanced providers or offline engines as a single, standard local endpoint.

## Routing Modes

Proxima supports two primary modes to power your editor and agent integrations:

### 1. Session Routing (Default)
*   **Free Account Emulation:** Routes prompts through your logged-in browser accounts (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity) inside sandboxed background browser views.
*   **No API Keys Required:** Reuses standard local cookies and browser sessions. No passwords or credentials are saved.
*   **Renderer-Level Interception:** Captures tokens directly from internal WebSocket and API streams, bypassing brittle HTML selectors for faster and more stable routing.

<blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; color: #d4af37; padding: 5px 15px; margin: 15px 0;">
  <strong>Note:</strong> <small><i>Session Mode automates your existing logged-in browser sessions (like any browser automation tool). This may technically fall outside some providers' standard ToS for programmatic access. It's your account, your session, your choice — but for production/commercial use, we recommend BYOK Mode with official API keys.</i></small>
</blockquote>

### 2. BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) Routing
*   **Broad Model Support:** Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, Groq, xAI, OpenRouter, Together, Fireworks, Mistral, and NVIDIA.
*   **Local Offline Hardware:** Intercepts configurations to run local models via **Ollama** or **LM Studio**.
*   **Secure Storage:** Keys are saved locally using your operating system's native keychain vault (via Electron's SafeStorage).
*   **Local Brain Integration:** Automatically applies context compaction, factual recall, and prompt-injection screening.

## Meet Proxima Agent

The repository contains `proxima-agent/`, a local Python assistant. It executes codebase edits, runs test suites, and drives browser tasks by routing LLM calls through Proxima. This allows the agent to run completely free using your website providers or with custom API keys via BYOK mode.

### Core Agent Capabilities

*   **Self-Healing Debugging Loop:** Executes code, captures terminal and test-suite errors, and iteratively refactors the codebase until all tests pass.
*   **Autonomous Browser Control:** Drives Chrome instances via Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) to interact with frontends, verify UI layouts, and test user flows.
*   **Dynamic Skill Generation:** Writes custom Python helper scripts on the fly, tests them, and packages them into reusable runtime skills (`skills.db`) to expand its capabilities.
*   **Symbol-Mapped Codebase Analysis:** Maps local files, builds class/function symbol hierarchies, and isolates relevant code blocks to handle large context limits efficiently.

### A Real-World Agent Scenario

Imagine you instruct the agent: *"Find the bug in my token verification module, patch it, and verify that the authentication tests pass."*

Here is the exact trace of how Proxima Agent executes this task:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor User
    participant Agent as Proxima Agent
    participant Code as Codebase
    participant Test as Test Suite
    participant Browser as Chrome (CDP)
    participant Audit as Reviewer Agent

    User->>Agent: "Find the bug in token verification..."
    Agent->>Code: 1. Ingest files & build symbol map
    Agent->>Test: 2. Run test suite to capture failure trace
    Agent->>Code: 3. Synthesize & write code patch
    Agent->>Browser: 4. Emulate login & verify user flow
    Agent->>Audit: 5. Spawn sub-agent to audit security
    Agent->>User: 6. Request approval (present diff & logs)
```

### Gated Execution Safety
The agent is bound by customizable safety permissions:
*   **Full Auto:** Executes all file writes and terminal commands instantly.
*   **Smart:** Auto-approves reading/searching but prompts you before running commands or overwriting code.
*   **Suggest:** Shows proposed code diffs and command lines, waiting for your manual approval.

---

## State, Memory & Prompt Management

To keep workflows fast and context accurate, Proxima features separate prompt and memory systems depending on the active routing engine.

### Context Tracking & Prompt Routing

*   **Session Mode:** In this mode, the target provider website (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) maintains the active conversation state. Sending a massive system prompt containing 40+ tool definitions on every message would bloat the browser's context window, increasing latency and cost. Instead, Proxima runs a fast local classifier every turn. It dynamically analyzes your task and injects only the necessary tool references and relevant self-generated procedural hints.
*   **BYOK & Local Mode:** Proxima's prompt compiler manages the message payload lifecycle for custom API keys and offline endpoints. It formats the conversation history, applies system instructions dynamically, and executes a context compaction loop to summarize older chat turns, preventing token limit errors during large developer prompts.

### Local SQLite Memory Engines

Proxima maintains four separate, local, SQLite-backed databases (`~/.proxima-agent/*.db`) to enable cross-session statefulness:

*   **Conversation Vault (`vault.db`):** Tracks session lineage (supporting parent-child structures for multi-agent forks) and stores message histories securely.
*   **Insight Store (`insights.db`):** Extracts and stores cross-session user preferences, workspace patterns, and environmental facts to prevent repetitive setups.
*   **Experience Learning (`memory.db`):** Automatically caches compilation errors, syntax exceptions, and the edits that resolved them. The agent queries this history during self-healing loops to apply proven fixes instantly.
*   **Procedural Skills (`skills.db`):** Caches and evaluates custom script actions generated during tasks. The agent evaluates new skills through a Bayesian priority model, promoting them to "proven" or demoting/deprecating them based on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) success rates.

    "proxima": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "C:/absolute/path/to/Proxima/src/mcp/index.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> 💡 **Tip:** You can copy the exact configuration block with your machine's absolute paths directly from the **Settings ➔ MCP Configuration** tab inside the Proxima desktop app window.

## Troubleshooting

### Python 3.10+ Environment shows "Error" or "Missing"

**Symptoms:** The Diagnostics panel shows a red ✗ next to *Python 3.10+ Environment* even though Python is installed on your system.

**Cause:** On Windows, the app installs to `C:\Program Files\Proxima` which is a protected directory. During first-time setup, `pip install` needs to write temporary files in the source folder and fails with "Access is denied" for standard (non-admin) users.

> **Versions 5.0.0+ with bundled wheel:** This issue is resolved automatically. The installer bundles a pre-built `.whl` package that installs directly into the virtual environment without writing to the app directory. If you still see this error, make sure you're running the latest build.

**Quick Fix (older builds):**

1. Close Proxima completely.
2. Right-click the **Proxima** app (desktop shortcut or Start menu).
3. Select **"Run as administrator"**.
4. Wait for the setup to complete — you'll see the Python status turn green ✓.
5. Close and reopen normally. Admin mode is only needed once.

**macOS / Linux:** This is rare on these platforms since app directories are usually user-owned. If it occurs, run the app once with `sudo` to complete the initial setup.

### Python is installed but Proxima can't find it

Make sure Python is on your system PATH:

- **Windows:** During Python installation, check **"Add Python.exe to PATH"** at the bottom of the installer. If you missed it, re-run the installer → *Modify* → check the PATH option.
- **macOS / Linux:** Run `python3 --version` in a terminal. If not found, install via [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or your package manager.

Proxima requires **Python 3.10 or higher**.

## Architecture

The system consists of three primary layers: the **Proxima Runtime Host**, the **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server**, and the **Local Agent Runtime**.

    BYOKMode -->|Dynamic Fallback / Decryption| OfficialAPIs
```

### 2. Core Subsystems

#### Browser Session Compliance Layer
For **Session Mode**, Proxima loads each provider inside isolated `BrowserView` containers. The compliance layer includes:
*   **User-Agent Management:** Maintains standard browser user-agent strings for compatibility.
*   **Page Context Configuration:** Sets up standard preload scripts for correct rendering and provider compatibility.
*   **Direct Response Streaming:** Engine scripts (`electron/providers/engines/*`) capture streaming tokens directly from provider HTTP responses for real-time output.

#### Worker Control Protocol (WCP)
The Agent's workflow engine uses an internal command protocol (WCP) for multi-step task delegation, research routing, and temporary state management across sub-agents. See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for protocol details.

#### BYOK Local Brain & Context Pipeline
When **BYOK Mode** is active, Proxima utilizes a local intelligence buffer:
*   **Factual Recall & Experience Log:** Stores previous code errors, terminal exceptions, and successful fixes in an encrypted SQLite database to avoid repeating programming mistakes.
*   **Context Compaction Pipeline:** Uses token-estimation and cheap pruning heuristics (`byok/context/`) to summarize long conversation loops when approaching provider limits (preventing out-of-context crashes).
*   **Ollama/LM Studio Bridge:** Intercepts unknown custom provider configurations and loops them through standard OpenAI-compatible endpoints to support offline, local hardware execution.

Read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for full structural diagrams and details.

## Security & Privacy

| Principle | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Local-first** | MCP/IPC (`:19222`) and REST/WS (`:3210`) bind to `127.0.0.1`. Nothing exposed to the internet. |
| **Credential isolation** | Session mode reuses existing browser logins — no passwords saved. BYOK keys are encrypted in your OS keychain (SafeStorage). |
| **No telemetry** | Only your explicit queries go to the providers you choose. |
| **Gated execution** | The agent executes code by design, protected by permission modes and a safety gate. |
| **SSRF protection** | `web_scrape` and the agent's web fetcher are SSRF-guarded. |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Proxima really free?
Yes. If you use **Session Mode**, it communicates with the official web platforms through your active browser login sessions. There are no fees, and you don't need any paid API keys. You only pay if you explicitly choose **BYOK Mode** to connect your own API tokens.

### Is my data private?
Yes. Proxima itself stores nothing on external servers—no logs, chats, keys, or sessions leave your machine, and your configuration remains encrypted locally (using SafeStorage). However, remember that **Session Mode** still sends your prompts to the third-party AI provider you're logged into (that's how any AI chat works). For fully offline privacy where your code never leaves your local hardware, use local models via **BYOK Mode**.

### How does Session Mode work without passwords?
Proxima loads secure, isolated browser tabs (called BrowserViews) inside the background. When you log into ChatGPT or Claude inside these views, the browser maintains your active session logins locally on your device, just like Chrome or Firefox does. Proxima simply uses these local sessions to send standard prompts.

### Can I run local offline models?
Yes. BYOK mode supports any OpenAI-compatible custom endpoints. You can run **Ollama** or **LM Studio** offline on your own machine and route all requests through Proxima.

### Does the Python agent delete or modify my code automatically?
No. By default, the agent runs in **Suggest** or **Smart** mode. It will show you exactly what changes it wants to make and wait for you to click "Approve" before modifying any files or running commands.
